                <h5>TEAMFIRE<span>Unstoppable</span></h5>
                <p>The final action of building an Unstoppable Team is letting go. It’s proving your trust and respect in your teammates by empowering them. One of the many differences between a group of individuals and a team is its ability to react. A
                    group of individuals will seek out permission via a formal (or worse, informal) chain of command; the team, on the other hand, will respond with speed because each member is empowered to make decisions, and those decisions will be
                    made in alignment with the team’s purpose. Empowerment without communication with context (pillar one, Connect), direction (pillar two, Achieve) and team contribution (pillar 3, Respect), is more in alignment with abdicating responsibility
                    than it is with delegating decision-making.</p>
